# Baseball Data Analysis ⚾📊

This repository contains a data analysis project exploring baseball statistics using Python and SQL. It demonstrates how to connect to, query, and analyze relational data from a local SQLite database directly within a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `python.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code, SQL queries, and data visualizations used to analyze the baseball dataset.
- `baseball.db`: An SQLite database file containing structured historical baseball data (e.g., players, teams, game statistics, and seasonal records).

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine to explore the data and run the notebook.

### Prerequisites

To run the Jupyter Notebook, you will need Python installed along with Jupyter and standard data analysis libraries.

You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install jupyter pandas sqlite3 matplotlib seaborn
